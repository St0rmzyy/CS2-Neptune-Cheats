Based on TKazer's iteration on previous
CS2 cheats. Modified several calls and addd substantial 
amount of obfuscation and polymorphism in an effort to keep it 
safe from VACnet for the forseeable future. Also compiled and am only publishing
the binary to keep the obfuscation methods as hidden as possible from Valve. At the
very least, it should slow them down since debugging this will take a lot of work with out source.
